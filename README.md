# Express.js Route Handler Missing Robust Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling.  The provided `bug.js` example shows a route that fetches a user by ID but lacks proper error handling for cases where the ID is invalid or the user is not found.  The improved version, `bugSolution.js`, adds comprehensive error handling to address these issues, returning informative error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.
